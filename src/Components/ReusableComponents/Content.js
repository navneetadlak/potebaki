      "subDescription": "Sole Proprietorship registration in India follows a unique approach, as there isn't a dedicated government-established registration process for this business structure. Instead, a proprietorship firm registration online gains recognition through tax registrations mandated by relevant laws and regulations. One pivotal tax registration is the GST (Goods and Services Tax) Registration, which must be secured under the proprietor's name to formalize the business's proprietorship status. This sole proprietorship registration signifies that the proprietor is conducting business within the framework of a proprietorship."
