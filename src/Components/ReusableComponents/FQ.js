           A proprietorship firm is a type of business structure where a
           single individual owns and manages the entire business. The

           making them a popular choice for small businesses and startups in
           India.

           There are mainly four types of proprietorship in India:

           needs, goals, and resources.

           What is the difference between proprietorship and firm?
         </h2>
         <p className="text-gray-700">
           Proprietorship and firm are often used interchangeably, but there
           is a subtle difference between the two. Proprietorship refers to a
           type of business structure where a single individual owns and
           manages the entire business, while a firm refers to a group of
           individuals who come together to carry out a business activity. In
           a firm, the ownership is shared among the partners, and the
           profits and losses are also shared among them. In contrast, in
           proprietorship, the proprietor has complete control over the
           business, and all the profits and losses belong to the proprietor
           alone.
