A trust is a fiduciary relationship involving the trustor, trustee, and beneficiary. The involved parties are outlined in the trust deed when applying for registration for trust creation. \n\n A trust is established when the trustor transfers a specific asset or property to the trustee for the ultimate benefit of the beneficiary. The beneficiary, who is typically a third party, may have a connection to both the trustor and the trustee.\n\n Therefore, the relationship between the parties involved is essential in defining trust. According to the Indian Trusts Act of 1882, a trust is defined as a 'Relationship between the trustor and trustee to hold specific benefits for the beneficiary.' ",

This concept became available with the implementation of the Companies Act in 2013. \n\n The primary objective behind creating one-person companies was to foster entrepreneurship and encourage the formalization of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). According to Section 2(62) of the Companies Act 2013, a company can be formed with just one director and one member, and interestingly, these roles can be held by the same individual. Simply, OPC Company registration allows a single person to set up a limited liability company in India. The following describes the eligibility and procedure to register one person company.",
