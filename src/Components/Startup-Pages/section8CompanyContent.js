In an LLP, partners enjoy limited liability, similar to shareholders in a company, while also benefiting from the flexibility and simplicity of a partnership. This arrangement grants the LLP its legal identity, allowing it to take legal actions and be subject to legal actions separately from its partners. \n\n LLPs have become popular among entrepreneurs in various industries because they shield partners' assets and have more straightforward regulatory requirements than traditional corporations. The concept of LLP was introduced in India in 2008 and is governed by the Limited Liability Partnership Act, offering a dependable and adaptable option for businesses of all sizes."

This concept became available with the implementation of the Companies Act in 2013. \n\n The primary objective behind creating one-person companies was to foster entrepreneurship and encourage the formalization of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). According to Section 2(62) of the Companies Act 2013, a company can be formed with just one director and one member, and interestingly, these roles can be held by the same individual. Simply, OPC Company registration allows a single person to set up a limited liability company in India. The following describes the eligibility and procedure to register one person company.",
