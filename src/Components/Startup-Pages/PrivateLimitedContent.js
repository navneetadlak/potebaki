This concept became available with the implementation of the Companies Act in 2013. \n\n The primary objective behind creating one-person companies was to foster entrepreneurship and encourage the formalization of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). According to Section 2(62) of the Companies Act 2013, a company can be formed with just one director and one member, and interestingly, these roles can be held by the same individual. Simply, OPC Company registration allows a single person to set up a limited liability company in India. The following describes the eligibility and procedure to register one person company.",
