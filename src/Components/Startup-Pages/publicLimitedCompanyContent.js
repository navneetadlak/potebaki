            "subTitle": "What is Public Limited Company?",
            "subDescription": "A public limited company is a form of corporate entity that permits the general public to hold ownership stakes through publicly traded shares. These shares are commonly exchanged on established stock markets, enabling a diverse group of brokers, investors, and traders to buy and sell equity. This structure allows individuals from various backgrounds to invest and hold shares in the company.\n\n Unlike private companies, public limited companies are governed by stricter regulatory and reporting standards. In India, the law governing public limited companies is primarily outlined in the Companies Act of 2013. The minimum members in public company is 7, and there is no limit on the maximum number of members /shareholders for starting a Public Limited Company.\n\n The day-to-day operations are managed by an executive team, but the broader ownership lies with the many shareholders who invest in the companys stock. These shareholders typically have voting rights that include the ability to vote on the election of the board of directors. The board then selects the executive team tasked with managing the company's ongoing business affairs.",
